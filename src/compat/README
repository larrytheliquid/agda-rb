src/compat

This is where library modules needed to maintain compatibility with older
versions of ghc live. When compiling with an older version this directory is
added to the include path.

At the moment the implementation thinks that it has access to the ghc-6.6
libraries so parts of these are copied here to make compiling with version 6.4
possible.
