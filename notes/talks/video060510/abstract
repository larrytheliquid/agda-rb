Agda II -- Take One

I will present the first version of the Agda II language and some of the
motivations behind it. In particular I will talk about what is in the language:

  * implicit arguments
  * datatypes and functions by pattern matching
  * fancy module system

and what is not:

  * pi in set
  * signatures and structures
  * inductive families

and try to convey the reasons why this is so. The presentation will be
accompanied by a healthy amount of simple examples illustrating the syntax of
the language and how the different features can be used.
