  -- This shouldn't really be eta contracted
  -- but we're eta contracting it anyway
  -- The reason is that eta contraction helps
  -- alot in with abstractions, so we rather be
  -- a little too aggressive than too conservative.
  -- It doesn't make sense for the argument to d
  -- to be implicit here anyway, if it could be
  -- inferred from the type eta contraction wouldn't
  -- be a problem (see test/succeed/Issue259b.agda)
